    "There are plenty of severity related to coliisons, for example, in a collision severities may be fatality, serious injury, injury, prop damage and etc. but we are reducing this types to two situation: 1. Property only damage collisions and 2. Injury collision.\n",
    "With appropriate data we can extract valuable knowledge from this prediction we are going to just name a few, for instance, we can understand the probability of injuries in types of collisions for example, rear end collisions result injuries or sidesweeps? also we can mark dangerous spots which the occurance of injury collisions in them are siginifcant, another insight which we can extract is the occurance of collisions especially injury ones in which weathers are more.\n",
